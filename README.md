## Download Pretrained Weights

This project uses pretrained model weights that are **not included** in the repository due to file size limits.

Please download the following file manually and place them in the root directory of the project:

- [`yolov7.pt`](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt) (~72 MB)  

> **Note:** Make sure this file is located in the same folder as your script (new_gaze.py) before running the code.

If you want, you can download the file via command line, for example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt
